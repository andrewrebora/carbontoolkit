# carbontoolkit
Automated tool for information gathering and vulnerability assessment.

Carbontoolkit is an automated tool created to assist the user in gathering information needed for a preliminary vulnerability assessment.  
It was meant to be used privately and be highly customizable; as a consequence, there might still be a few issues to address.
I provide Censys keys but I suggest tailoring carbontoolkit.conf for your personal needs.
